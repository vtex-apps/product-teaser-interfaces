> Interfaces for a product teaser app.

This app provides extensible interfaces that can be used by the `vtex.store` and a theme app. A product teaser app would depend on this app and extend the interfaces provided to become available in the store.

You can see an [example of a product teaser app here](/example).

## Use cases

1. Display promotional data related to a product.
2. Promote special conditions of payments.
